## How to interpret the results

A win rate alone is not a trading edge. We must examine risk-adjusted out-of-sample returns, sample size, market regime, costs, feed freshness and rejected decisions.
Position size decreases after at least 20 closed paper trades if expectancy is weak; this is bounded adaptive sizing, not a trained self-improving prediction model.
Scheduled sampling can miss interim price moves and delays stop triggers. Backtesting and paper trading are not proof of real profitability.
